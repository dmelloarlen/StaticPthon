            Glass can be broadly classified into several categories, each with specific characteristics and uses:

            - **Soda-lime Glass**: The most common type, used in windows and bottles. It contains silica, soda, and lime.
            - **Lead Glass**: Known for its clarity and brilliance, used in decorative items and radiation shielding.
            - **Borosilicate Glass**: Resistant to thermal shock, used in laboratory glassware and cookware.
            - **Aluminosilicate Glass**: High-strength glass used in electronic displays and industrial applications.
            - **Specialty Glass**: Includes various other types like colored glass, fiber glass, and laminated glass, tailored for specific uses.
